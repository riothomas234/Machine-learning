[Makemore2](makemore3.ipynb) implements a character-level neural network language model using PyTorch to generate names. The model learns character embeddings and predicts the next character in a sequence given a fixed-length context (3 characters). It is trained on a dataset of names, split into training, validation, and test sets (80/10/10).
